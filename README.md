`aniwatch-dl.sh` is a powerful command-line tool written in Bash to download anime series and episodes from an [AniWatch-compatible API](https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch-api) instance. It offers features like anime searching, flexible episode selection, resolution preference, server choice, and subtitle management.

> [!NOTE]
> This script is designed to work with a running instance of an AniWatch-compatible API. You must configure the script to point to a valid API endpoint before use. See the [Configuration](#Ô∏è-configuration) section for details.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Anime Discovery:**
    *   Search for anime by name.
    *   Select from search results using an interactive `fzf` menu with detailed previews.
    *   Alternatively, specify anime directly by its API ID.
*   **Flexible Episode Selection:**
    *   Download single episodes, multiple specific episodes, ranges, or all available.
    *   Exclude specific episodes or ranges.
    *   Select the latest 'N', first 'N', from 'N' onwards, or up to 'N' episodes.
    *   Combine selection criteria (e.g., `"1-10,!5,L2"`).
    *   Interactive prompt for episode selection if not provided via command-line.
*   **Download Customization:**
    *   Choose preferred audio type (subbed or dubbed).
    *   Specify preferred resolution via keywords (e.g., "1080", "720") to select the M3U8 variant stream.
    *   Specify preferred server via keywords (e.g., "megacloud", "vidstreaming") to filter server choices.
    *   If no resolution preference is given, selects the highest bandwidth M3U8 variant stream by default.
*   **Subtitle Management:**
    *   Default behavior: Downloads an "English" subtitle track if available.
    *   `-L <langs>`: Option to specify preferred subtitle languages (e.g., "eng,spa,jpn").
    *   `-L all`: Option to download all available subtitles.
    *   `-L none`: Option to disable subtitle downloads.
*   **Efficient Downloading:**
    *   Parallel segment downloads using GNU Parallel for faster HLS stream processing.
    *   Configurable number of download threads (`-t <num>`).
    *   Optional timeout for individual segment downloads (`-T <secs>`).
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Colorized and informative terminal output.
    *   Debug mode (`-d`) for verbose logging.
    *   Option to list stream links without downloading (`-l`).
    *   Organized video downloads into `~/Videos/AniWatchAnime/<Anime Title>/` by default (configurable via `ANIWATCH_DL_VIDEO_DIR`).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use `aniwatch-dl.sh`, you need the following command-line tools installed on your system:

*   **`bash`**: Version 4.0 or higher recommended.
*   **`curl`**: For making HTTP requests to the API and downloading files.
*   **`jq`**: For parsing JSON responses from the API.
*   **`fzf`**: For interactive selection menus.
*   **`ffmpeg`**: For concatenating downloaded HLS video segments and embedding metadata.
*   **`GNU Parallel`**: For parallel downloading of HLS segments.
*   **`mktemp`**: For creating temporary directories (usually part of coreutils).

</details>

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Download the script:**
    Save the script content as `aniwatch-dl.sh` in your desired location.

    ```bash
    # using curl:
    curl -o aniwatch-dl.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruxartic/aniwatch-dl/main/aniwatch-dl.sh

    # using git (clone the repo):
    git clone https://github.com/ruxartic/aniwatch-dl.git
    cd aniwatch-dl
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x aniwatch-dl.sh
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Place it in your PATH:**
    For easier access, move or symlink `aniwatch-dl.sh` to a directory in your `PATH`, like `~/.local/bin/`:

    ```bash
    # Example: create a symlink named 'animew'
    ln -s /path/to/your/aniwatch-dl.sh ~/.local/bin/animew
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The script **requires** the `ANIWATCH_API_URL` environment variable to be set to the base URL of your API instance.

1.  **Set the Environment Variable `ANIWATCH_API_URL`**: This is the **only** way to configure the API endpoint.

    ```bash
    # Example for your current shell session:
    export ANIWATCH_API_URL="https://your-aniwatch-api.vercel.app"
    # Then run the script:
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -a "Frieren"
    ```

    To make this configuration permanent, add the `export` line to your shell's startup file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The script will fail with an error if the `ANIWATCH_API_URL` environment variable is not set or is empty.

**Other Environment Variables:**

*   **`ANIWATCH_DL_VIDEO_DIR`**: Sets the root directory for downloaded anime.
    *   Default: `"$HOME/Videos/AniWatchAnime"`
    *   Example: `export ANIWATCH_DL_VIDEO_DIR="$HOME/MyAnime"`
*   **`ANIWATCH_DL_TMP_DIR`**: Sets a custom parent directory for temporary files.
    *   Default: `"$ANIWATCH_DL_VIDEO_DIR/.tmp"`
    *   Example: `export ANIWATCH_DL_TMP_DIR="/mnt/fast-ssd/tmp"`

### Examples

*   **Search for "Frieren" and download episode 1 (subbed, default subtitle behavior):**

    ```bash
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -a "Frieren" -e 1
    ```

*   **Download episodes 5 to 10 and the latest 2 of an anime with ID `sousou-no-frieren-18456`, dubbed:**

    ```bash
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -i "sousou-no-frieren-18456" -e "5-10,L2" -o dub
    ```

*   **Download episodes 1-5 using 8 threads for faster downloading:**
    ```bash
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -a "Solo Leveling" -e "1-5" -t 8
    ```

*   **Download all episodes of an anime except ep 3, prefer 720p, and get Spanish subtitles:**

    ```bash
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -a "Some Anime" -e "*,!3" -r 720 -L spa
    ```

*   **List stream links for episode 1 of "Another Anime" without downloading:**

    ```bash
    ./aniwatch-dl.sh -a "Another Anime" -e 1 -l
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Initialization**: Reads `ANIWATCH_API_URL` and other environment variables, then checks for dependencies.
2.  **Anime Identification**:
    *   With `-a`, searches via `/api/v2/hianime/search` and uses `fzf` for interactive selection.
    *   With `-i`, fetches info directly from `/api/v2/hianime/anime/{anime_id}`.
3.  **Episode List Retrieval**: Fetches all episodes via `/api/v2/hianime/anime/{anime_id}/episodes`.
4.  **Episode Selection**: Parses the `-e <selection>` string or prompts the user interactively.
5.  **Stream Details Acquisition (for each episode):**
    *   Gets a server list from `/api/v2/hianime/episode/servers`.
    *   Filters servers by user preferences (`-S`, `-o`).
    *   Gets the final stream info (M3U8 URL, subtitles) from `/api/v2/hianime/episode/sources`.
6.  **M3U8 Handling (HLS):**
    *   Downloads the master M3U8 playlist.
    *   Parses it to find available quality variants.
    *   Selects the best variant based on `-r <keyword>` or the highest bandwidth.
    *   Downloads the corresponding media M3U8 which contains the segment URLs.
7.  **Downloading**:
    *   HLS segments are downloaded in parallel using GNU Parallel.
    *   Subtitles are downloaded based on the `-L <langs>` preference.
8.  **Assembly (HLS)**: `ffmpeg` safely concatenates all downloaded segments into a single `.mp4` file and embeds the episode title and number as metadata.
9.  **File Organization**: Saves files to `ANIWATCH_DL_VIDEO_DIR/ANIME_TITLE/Episode_NUM_TITLE.mp4`.
10. **Cleanup**: Atomically removes only the temporary directories created during its own run, ensuring safety during concurrent script executions.
